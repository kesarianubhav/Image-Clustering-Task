# Unsupervised-Image-Clustering

Task was to -
Take the Baseball dataset and do unsupervised image classification on visually similar images using a neural network.

-> Used the Concept of Tranfer Learning

-> Used the VGG-16 ImageNet Convolutional Neural Network to extract the features from the images 

-> And then fed those features into the clustering algo to cluster
